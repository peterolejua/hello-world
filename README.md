# hello-world

I'm Peter Olejua. A mathematician and future biostatistician original from Venezuela. Currently I'm studying a Master in Biostatistics in the Javeriana University in Colombia-Bogot√°.

I'm starting to use github and in my first project I aim to write the class notes of my Master program.

Appreciation is welcome, thanks.
